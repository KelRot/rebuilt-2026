Team 5655's 2026 FRC robot code for Rebuilt. This code is written in Java and is based off of WPILib's Java control system. There are multiple subsystems functioning different parts of the robot with scheduled commands using the advantages of command-base.

We are going to be using this code for Marmara Regional 2026 and might in Houston?.

This codebase is all public for everyone!
